### <center> Code Review </center>

A code review is a methodical way of checking code for completeness and quality before it is used. This is important because it addresses many common issues that could arise in coding. These issues could include missed requirements, security vulnerabilities, bugs, or just general coding best practices that may have been missed. 

<code> A code review was conducted for each of the following three projects before they underwent enhancement. Please feel free to watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/f0aFHuVSD4M">here</a>. </code>

### <center> Project One: Software Engineering and Design </center>

The first project that was chosen for enhancement was a project developed for IT140 (Intro to Scripting) near the beginning of the pursuit of my degree three years ago. The text-based game that I created, called Batman: Cave of Injustice, was developed using the Python coding language and the PyCharm IDE. Players must navigate through various rooms to collect all of Batman's gadgets before facing the final boss (Superman), who has been filled with anger after being exposed to a toxin developed by The Joker.

This project is important to me and was chosen as an inclusion in my portfolio because it shows my progrss over the last three years. The enhancements made to it are meant to showcase my ability to organize, modularize, and develop in a way that promotes maintainability and collaboration. The implementation of data structures like dictionaries and arrays allowed the code to be cleaned up and simplified significantly. This meets course outcomes for employing strategies for building collaborative environments as well as designing and evaluating computer solutions that solve problems using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards.
