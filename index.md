### <center> Code Review </center>

A code review is a methodical way of checking code for completeness and quality before it is used. This is important because it addresses many common issues that could arise in coding. These issues could include missed requirements, security vulnerabilities, bugs, or just general coding best practices that may have been missed. 

<code> A code review was conducted for each of the following three projects before they underwent enhancement. Please feel free to watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/f0aFHuVSD4M">here</a>. </code>
