### <center> Code Review </center>

A code review is a methodical way of checking code for completeness and quality before it is used. This is important because it addresses many common issues that could arise in coding. These issues could include missed requirements, security vulnerabilities, bugs, or just general coding best practices that may have been missed. 

<code> A code review was conducted for each of the following three projects before they underwent enhancement. Please feel free to watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/f0aFHuVSD4M">here</a>. </code>

### <center> Project One: Software Engineering and Design </center>

The first project that was chosen for enhancement was a text-based game developed in IT140 (Intro to Scripting). The game that I created, called Batman: Cave of Injustice, was developed using the Python coding language and the PyCharm IDE. Players must navigate through various rooms to collect all of Batman's gadgets before facing the final boss (Superman), who has been filled with anger after being exposed to a toxin developed by The Joker.
