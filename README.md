# Project Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

## Slideshow ##

The project that I chose to represent algorithms and data structures is a slideshow project developed in CS250 (Software and Development Lifecycle) in December of 2022. For this project, we were given code snippets and wer etasked with adding to it to create a slideshow for vacation destinations. We used Java as a coding language and the Eclipse IDE. The requirements were to create 5 destination slides, each with their own image and description. A 'next' or 'previous' button would navigate through the slides.

This project was initially developed with very little in terms of data structures or algorithms. It was sorted in a static manner in whatever order the data was entered into the code. The main enhancements that I made to this project were the implementations of these things. By adding a class for the destinations, I was able to implement an array of objects to hold each destination. I could then iterate through the array to get the data. This also allowed me to add the other large enhancement which is a sorting option for the users. There is now a dropdown box on the slideshow that will allow the user to reload the slideshow sorted by the destination names or the rating.

Additional enhancements made to the original file were improved comments and a more polished visual experience. The old slideshow looked stretched out and had a color scheme that often blended the text together with the background. It looked messy and uninviting. The new visuals look more sleek and refined.

Course Outcomes Displayed
----
### Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. ###
----
The implementation of an array of objects is a well-founded technique that accomplished the goal of organizing data for easier sorting and retrieval. It allows all data to be centralized and flexible.

### Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. ###
----
The improved code with better organization, more complete commenting, and better maintainability is developed in a professional manner. The enhanced visuals of the project leads to a more professional appearance to the user.

### Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. ###
----
Having a sorting option available where the user can re-sort the data on the fly was done by implementing sorting algorithms within action listeners. The sorting functions used adhere to best practices and standards because they are proven functions that were implemented with simplicity in mind to enhance maintainability.
